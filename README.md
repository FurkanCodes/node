# Welcome to YAF

_Yet Another Framework (That I'm Building to Learn)_

Is the world ready for another Node.js framework? No.
Am I building one anyway to learn? Absolutely.

Welcome to YAF, where we're not trying to replace Express.js, we're just trying to figure out how Express.js works by building something similar but probably worse.

Features:

- Fast (when it works)
- Simple (because I don't know how to make it complex yet)
- Zero Dependencies (because I haven't figured out how to use them properly)
- Fully Documented (with comments like "I think this works")
